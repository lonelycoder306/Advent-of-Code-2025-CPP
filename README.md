This repo will contain all the code I write for the challenges published in [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

The code will all be in C++, though there may be additional files with the code that were used with it, as well as (possibly) answer files in case someone would like to run the code themselves and compare with the written answers.

Note: all the code compiles with C++17 or later, and was compiled (without warnings or errors) with the following flags:\
`-Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic`
